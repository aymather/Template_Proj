# Template.m

This is a skeleton of an experiment. We tend to do the same exact process over and over upon creating a new experiment. Now we can simply download these starter-files and begin coding the fun stuff!

# Setup

Download files from github
- `git clone https://github.com/wessellab/exp-template.git`

**And that's it!**

# Usage

The entry point, or shell script, is called 'index.m'

To name your project, change the name of the `PROJECT_NAME` string variable near the beginning of this shell script. **If you do this, you must also change the name of the shell script to whatever you just named your project!**


Happy coding :)
